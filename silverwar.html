        Silver War is a first-person shooter where 
        the player is a piece of silverware using tiny guns to dismember zombie food 
        enemies. The cartoony art style mixed with explosive action makes for a thrilling
        playthrough that anybody can enjoy.</td>

        Silver war is also the most polished project I've ever worked on. With more than 
        400 hours of effort from myself and two designers, the scope of the game is much 
        larger than others in my collection.</td>

        Silver War was born when my project partners thought it would be funny to put
        googly eyes on food. They began envisioning a silly game in the spirit of something
        like Sausage Party. We set out to make a silly crossover between crazy food and zombie
        games like Left 4 Dead.

    <h1 style="color:white">Project Details</h1>
</center>
    <p style="color:white;">Silver War was a capstone level university project in which we were alotted 
        twenty weeks to create a polished, functional game with 10+ minutes of
        gameplay in groups of three. The scope of the project made for a time crunch
        that forced us to work on a schedule. Using industry tactics like Agile-SCRUM
        and technical design documents, we were able to create fluid goals that allowed
        us to create a solid project well within the time crunch.
        <br><br> 
        A lot of things changed from the way we originally planned Silver War to go.
        One of the biggest changes was that we needed to cut co-op multiplayer from
        the scope. As our stretch goal, it wasn't a huge milestone to miss -- but
        it defeated the purpose of features such as selecting a character, or
        having unique bonuses for characters.
        <br><br>
        Another thing cut from the scope was the Caprisun enemy. While all enemies in
        the game currently use melee attacks, the Caprisun was a ranged attacker. While
        this enemy would have made our waves more dynamic, we unfortunately ran out of
        time to model them.
        <br><br>
        One of my favorite prototype features was enemies that came out of cereal boxes.
        The player would walk up to a closed cereal box, and it would suddenly burst
        open with cheerio enemies.
        Unfortunately, we lost flexibility to move the flaps on boxes when we modelled
        them with textures.  
        <br><br>
        Despite all of these feature changes, Silver War turned out to be an incredible
        success. The gameplay is longer than we planned for. It also contains new features
        not from the documents. Some of these include explosions, realtime world events,
        and interactive objects. Overall, the game is more than capable of releasing as
        a small scale indie game. I learned a lot from the work I put into this game as a developer.
